****************
Why I made this.
****************

Inspired by Simtropolis' ( http://www.simtropolis.com ) own City Name
Generator, I decided to make one myself. Why? Because the Simtropolis
one was online only and I don't have the luxury of being online whenever
I want to.

So I decided to make a small app I could use whenever I alt+tab out of
Simcity 4. The program you have downloaded is the result.

**************
How to install
**************

Just unzip everything out of the zipfile into a folder. Make sure every
file is in the same folder. Run the SiNG.exe program.

***********************
How to use this program
***********************

I don't think you'll need any instructions on how to use this little app,
right? Right? No? Bah.

Since this program was designed with Simcity 4 in mind, I'll explain it
using that version. But you could use it for any Simcity, probably even
Simcity SNES! Heck, you could even use it for Transport Tycoon Deluxe
(and that's not even Simcity)!

What you do is, first load Simcity 4. Start a new city. When it asks you
what you want to name your city and what the mayor's name is, ALT+TAB out
of Simcity 4. Load the Simcity Name Generator. Generate a name. Select
the name with your cursor, press CTRL+C to copy the name, then ALT+TAB
back into Simcity 4, click in the field where you're supposed to type
the city name or mayor's name, then press CTRL+V. Voila, Instant name.

Or you could just think up one yourself. In which case, I question you
downloading this program.

Anyways, have fun.

************
How it works
************

The Simcity Name Generator works by pulling names randomly from text
files located in the same folder as the program itself. There are 7 text
files in all, 4 to generate city names and 3 to generate mayor names.

The 4 city name files are :

a) names.txt - contains random names suitable for cities
b) prefix.txt - contains random prefixes to add in front of the city name
c) midfix.txt - contains names to add between the city name and suffix
d) suffix.txt - contains suffixes to add to the back of the city name

The Simcity Name Generator will combine the names as such:

prefix.txt + names.txt + midfix.txt + suffix.txt

If you didn't select the "add prefix" or "add middle name" options, then
the prefix and midfix values will be empty. Meaning that names generated
with the options not selected will be generated thus:

names.txt + suffix.txt

The 3 mayor name files are :

a) mayormale.txt - contains random male names
b) mayorfemale.txt - contains random female names
c) surname.txt - contains random surnames

The Simcity Name Generator will combine the names as such:

mayormale.txt + surname.txt OR
mayorfemale.txt + surname.txt

depending on which option you selected.

The Simcity Name Generator can generate much more than 25,000 possible
city names (actually it's probably close to 4 million, can't remember my
math) but if that's not enough, you can add your own city or mayor names
by editing the text files. Some generated city names can be quite
humourous (especially if you enable prefixes and midfixes)! Have fun!
